# CHANGELOG


## v0.7.82

### Added
* #### Hidden albums

    You can now hide albums, just like individual memories.

* #### Album improvements

    You can now pin your favourite albums, and set cover photos for them.

    We have also added a way to first create empty albums, and then add photos to it, both from ente and your device gallery.


* #### Email verification

    We have now made email verification optional, so you can sign in with just your email address and password, without waiting for a verification code.

    If you would still like to enforce email verification, you can opt-in from Settings > Security.


* #### Bug fixes & other enhancements

    We have squashed a few pesky bugs that were reported by our community, and have improved the experience for albums and quick links.

    If you would like to help us improve ente, come join the party @ ente.io/community!


## v0.7.71

    You can now explore the photos you've taken around the world!

    Click on the Map icon on the Search screen to view your photos laid out on a map.

* #### Cover Photos ✨
    You can now set cover photos for your albums.

    Open an album, and click on the overflow menu on the top right corner to pick your favorite memory from that album.

### Improvements

* **Translations**: Add support for German language

## 0.7.62

### Added
#### Collages ✨

Create collages out of your favorite photos!

Select your photos, and click on "Create collage" to build a single frame that captures your whole memory.


#### Album sort order

You can now choose how photos within your albums are ordered – newest or oldest first.

This is useful for albums of trips and events, where you wish to see your stories unfold along their original timelines.

Click on the overflow menu within an album to configure how it's sorted.


#### Shared album improvements

Photos in albums that are shared with you will now be shown in your home gallery. You can hide them by simply archiving the shared album.


### Improvements


We've worked super hard to improve how smoothly our home gallery scrolls. Skimming through your memories should be a lot more enjoyable now.
