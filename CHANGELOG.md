## 0.7.62

### Added
#### Collages ✨

Create collages out of your favorite photos!

Select your photos, and click on "Create collage" to build a single frame that captures your whole memory.


#### Album sort order

You can now choose how photos within your albums are ordered – newest or oldest first.

This is useful for albums of trips and events, where you wish to see your stories unfold along their original timelines.

Click on the overflow menu within an album to configure how it's sorted.
